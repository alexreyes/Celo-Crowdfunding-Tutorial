# 1. Building a Crowdfunding Smart Contract in Celo

We're going to write a smart contract in Solidity which facilitates crowdfunding (like GoFundMe, Kickstarter, and Indiegogo) on Celo in 160 lines of code. 

The usual way of doing this might involve Plaid (banking), Stripe (payments), a database (for storing data), and AWS (for hosting):

Solidity and Celo make building the backend for this easy! Not to mention, ðŸŒŽ from day one.

# Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have experience programming (ideally in Solidity). 

Before you continue, make sure you have truffle installed. If you don't, run the following line of code in your terminal: 

`npm install -g truffle`


# Project setup 

First, open the terminal and make a new project folder. Weâ€™ll call if celo-crowdfunding:

`mkdir celo-crowdfunding && cd celo-crowdfunding`

Next, letâ€™s initialize the project directory with NPM

`npm init -y`

After itâ€™s been initialized, weâ€™ll need to install some additional packages for interacting with the smart contract in the next tutorial. Hereâ€™s an overview of them:
* ContractKit is a package created by the Celo team to aid in Celo development
* Dotenv is used for reading environment variables in our code
* Web3 is a library which facilitates our interactions with the blockchain
* OpenZeppelin contracts is a library of battle-tested solidity code  snippets we will reuse

Install all of the above using:

`npm install -â€”save @celo/contractkit dotenv web3 @openzeppelin/contracts`

After all the NPM packages have installed, run this command to initialize Truffle: 

``truffle init``

Here's what a successful run of truffle init will look like:

# Writing the Contract

First things first, open the newly created project in your favorite code editor and create a file called **CeloCrowdfund.sol** in your ``contracts/`` folder.

At the top of the file, add the Solidity version and import the SafeMath contract from OpenZeppelin: 

```
pragma solidity >=0.4.22 <0.9.0;

// Importing OpenZeppelin's SafeMath Implementation
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol";
```
SafeMath is a wrapper for ``uint256`` in Solidity. We use SafeMath because integers in Solidity are vulnerable to overflow errors which can cause significant problems for our smart contracts. 

Next, we're going to initialize our contract: 
```
contract CeloCrowdfund {
  // SafeMath for safe integer operations
  using SafeMath for uint256;

  // List of all the projects
  Project[] private projects;
}
```
This is the start of the CeloCrowdfund contract. It includes a line to use SafeMath and an array of the ``Project`` type. ``Project`` is what we'll call our contract to handle each project users create. 

Let's get to building that ``Project`` contract. In the same file as the ``CeloCrowdfund contract``, create a ``Project`` contract and an ``enum`` called ``ProjectState``:

```
contract Project {
  using SafeMath for uint256;
  
  enum ProjectState {
    Fundraising,
    Expired,
    Successful
  }
}
```
We create an ``enum`` called ``ProjectState`` in order to keep track of a project's current state. A project can be in the fundraising, expired, or successful state. We use ``enum`` because it creates a custom type for ``ProjectState``. 


## Expanding the Project contract

Next, we'll add some public variables which describe a ``Project``. It should look like this: 

```
contract Project {
  using SafeMath for uint256;
  
  enum ProjectState {
    Fundraising,
    Expired,
    Successful
  }
  // Initialize public variables
  address payable public creator;
  uint public goalAmount;
  uint public completeAt;
  uint256 public currentBalance;
  uint public raisingDeadline;
  string public title;
  string public description;
  string public imageLink;

  // Initialize state at fundraising
  ProjectState public state = ProjectState.Fundraising;  
	
  mapping (address => int) public contributions;
}
```
**Note**: Since these variables are all ``public``, they can be accessed by any other Solidity contract or dApp. 

After initializing the first set of variables, we set the ``state`` variable to start at a fundraising state when the Project is initialized. Next we create a [mapping](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.4.21/types.html#mappings) from user addresses to to the amount they donate as a ``uint`` to keep track of the contributions made for the Project instance. A mapping is like a hash table or dictionary for Solidity. 

Now, we'll add add some [events](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.3/contracts.html#events) and a modifier after the mapping: 
```
  // Event when funding is received
  event ReceivedFunding(address contributor, uint amount, uint currentTotal);

  // Event for when the project creator has received their funds
  event CreatorPaid(address recipient);

  modifier theState(ProjectState _state) {
    require(state == _state);
   _;
  }
```

When we call the ``ReceivedFunding`` and  ``CreatorPaid`` events they will cause the arguments of the event to be stored in the transaction's logs on the blockchain. This is helpful for having timestamps and additional info on transactions being made by our contract. 

We also use a [modifier](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.3/contracts.html#function-modifiers) to check that the state of the project is always of type ``state``. Modifiers are a way to check a condition before executing a function in Solidity. We'll use the modifier in a couple of functions later in our smart contract. 

Next, we'll add a constructor for the ``Project`` contract after the modifier:
```
constructor
(
  address payable projectCreator,
  string memory projectTitle, 
  string memory projectDescription,
  string memory projectImageLink,
  uint fundRaisingDeadline,
  uint projectGoalAmount
) {
  creator = projectCreator;
  title = projectTitle; 
  description = projectDescription; 
  imageLink = projectImageLink; 
  goalAmount = projectGoalAmount;
  raisingDeadline = fundRaisingDeadline;
  currentBalance = 0;
}
```
If you've done some object oriented programming in the past, constructors should be familiar to you. They're essentially the parameters you need to create a ``Project`` object. 

### The Contribute() function

Next, let's create a function in the ``Project`` contract for contributing money to a project: 
```
// Fund a project
function contribute() external theState(ProjectState.Fundraising) payable {
  require(msg.sender != creator);
  contributions[msg.sender] = contributions[msg.sender].add(msg.value);

  currentBalance = currentBalance.add(msg.value);

  emit ReceivedFunding(msg.sender, msg.value, currentBalance);

  checkIfFundingCompleteOrExpired();
}
```
The ``contribute()`` function is an external function. This means it can only be called from other smart contracts or transactions. 

The first thing the ``contribute()`` function does is check that the user calling the function with a transaction (msg.sender) is not the project creator: 

``require(msg.sender != creator);``

Next, it adds the user's address to the mapping of ``contributions`` with the user's address as the key and the funding amount as the value:  

``contributions[msg.sender] = contributions[msg.sender].add(msg.value);``

Then the function updates the project's current balance and emits a ``ReceivedFunding`` log: 

```
currentBalance = currentBalance.add(msg.value);

emit ReceivedFunding(msg.sender, msg.value, currentBalance);
```

### The checkIfFundingCompleteOrExpired() function

Finally, the function calls ``checkIfFundingCompleteOrExpired();`` which doesn't exist yet. Let's create that now! 

Write the following function in the ``Project`` contract:
```
// check project state
function checkIfFundingCompleteOrExpired() public {
  if (currentBalance >= goalAmount) {
    state = ProjectState.Successful;
    payOut();
  } 
  else if (block.timestamp > raisingDeadline) {
    state = ProjectState.Expired;
  }
  
  completeAt = block.timestamp;
}
```
This function checks if the currentBalance for a project is greater than the goal amount. If it is, it changes the project state to successful and pays out the the project creator using the payOut() function. 

If the deadline is past the `block.timestamp` (the current time of the most recent block), then the project has expired and the state is updated. 

Next, let's make the payOut() function. 

### The payOut() function

Below the ``checkIfFundingCompleteOrExpired()`` function, add the following for ``payOut()``: 
```
function payOut() internal theState(ProjectState.Successful) returns (bool) {
  uint256 totalRaised = currentBalance;
  currentBalance =  0;
  
  if (creator.send(totalRaised)) {
    emit CreatorPaid(creator);
    return  true;
  } 
  else {
    currentBalance = totalRaised;
    state = ProjectState.Successful;
  }
   
  return  false;
}
```

The ``payOut()`` function will send the full amount raised by a project to the project creator. 

It first sets the total raised to be the currentBalance, and resets the current balance: 
```
uint256 totalRaised = currentBalance;
currentBalance = 0;
```

Next it sends the money to the contract creator with the ``.send()`` solidity function and emits a ``CreatorPaid`` log: 

```
if (creator.send(totalRaised)) {
  emit CreatorPaid(creator);
  return true;
} 
 ```

### The getDetails() function

Finally, we're going to add the last function in our ``Project`` contract, the ``getDetails()`` function. 

```
function  getDetails() public  view  returns
(
  address payable projectCreator,
  string memory projectTitle,
  string memory projectDescription,
  string memory projectImageLink,
  uint fundRaisingDeadline,
  ProjectState currentState, 
  uint256 projectGoalAmount, 
  uint256 currentAmount
) {
  projectCreator = creator;
  projectTitle = title;
  projectDescription = description;
  projectImageLink = imageLink;
  fundRaisingDeadline = raisingDeadline;
  currentState = state;
  projectGoalAmount = goalAmount;
  currentAmount = currentBalance;
}
```
This function is pretty simple. It returns the information about the project by returning the public variables we set at the start of the ``Project`` contract. 

## Back to the CeloCrowdfund contract

![Celo crowdfund contract back to the future image](https://i.imgur.com/UFqJB0z.png)

It's time to get back to the ``CeloCrowdfund`` contract, now that we've finished the ``Project`` contract. 

We'll start by adding an ``event`` for when a project is started: 
```
contract CeloCrowdfund {
  // SafeMath for safe integer operations
  using SafeMath for uint256;

  // List of all the projects
  Project[] private projects;
	
  // event for when new project starts
  event ProjectStarted(
    address contractAddress,
    address projectCreator,
    string title,
    string description,
    string imageLink,
    uint256 fundRaisingDeadline,
    uint256 goalAmount
  );
}
```
We've used ``events`` in a couple of places in the contract so far. We're going to use this ``event`` to log when a project is created to the blockchain. 

Next, let's make the ``startProject`` function in the ``CeloCrowdfund`` contract to start a project: 
```
function startProject(
  string calldata title, 
  string calldata description,
  string calldata imageLink,
  uint durationInDays,
  uint amountToRaise
) external {
  uint raiseUntil = block.timestamp.add(durationInDays.mul(1 days));
  
  Project newProject = new Project(payable(msg.sender), title, description, imageLink, raiseUntil, amountToRaise);
  projects.push(newProject);
  
  emit ProjectStarted(
    address(newProject),
    msg.sender,
    title,
    description,
    imageLink,
    raiseUntil,
    amountToRaise
  );
}
```
The ``startProject`` function takes in some basic info for creating a project like the title, description, imageLink, duration, and amount to raise. 

It then makes the ``raiseUntil`` variable by multiplying the ``durationInDays`` by ``1 days``. This will turn the ``durationInDays`` variable from a ``uint`` to something ``block.timestamp`` will accept. 

Next, our ``startProject`` function creates a ``newProject`` of type ``Project`` (from our ``Project`` contract) with the parameters the ``Project`` contract constructor takes.

Finally, the function emits a ``ProjectStarted`` log. 

One last thing for our ``CeloCrowdfund`` contract: we'll add a function to return the list of ``Projects`` created:
```
function returnProjects() external view returns(Project[] memory) {
  return projects;
}
```

And that's it for our two contracts! 

# Conclusion 

Just like that, we've created a smart contract which will allow for crowdfunding in Celo. The full source code is available on Github [here](https://github.com/alexreyes/Celo-Crowdfunding-Tutorial).

Hopefully creating this smart contract has given you a sense of what's possible. Without too much hassle and infrastructure setup, we're able to use this contract to accept payments and help users coordinate towards raising money for a project they want to support.

In the next tutorial, we will discuss deploying the contracts to the Celo network!

**Note**: This tutorial and smart contract is based on the [contracts for Coperacha](https://github.com/Alex-Neo-Projects/Coperacha-contracts) an app built by the tutorial author.  If you want to see these contracts being used in a mobile app, you can see an example of that [here](https://github.com/Alex-Neo-Projects/Coperacha-app).
